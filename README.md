# This is my personal quantum computing exercises

It will tend to be quite a mess as I'm trying to do new stuffs.

This personal project will be hosted mainly at GitHub:
https://github.com/BagusThanatos/quantumcomputing
with backup hosted at BitBucket:
https://bitbucket.org/bagusthanatos/quantumcomputing

Each folder represents different Quantum Computing API/Library used.

This project requires python and virtualenv installed.

Please run this first to install all dependencies for all APIs used.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start_work_windows.bat should be run first before working on anything.
